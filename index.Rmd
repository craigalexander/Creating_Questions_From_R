# Overview
In this session, we will take a look at how we can use R to generate data to create questions. The first example will work through question 1 of Paper 1 from the 2021 exam. You can access the [paper](https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/NAH_Statistics_Paper1_2021.pdf) and [solutions](Advanced Higher Statistic marking instructions paper 1) by clicking on the links. The second example will introduce how to generate data for a simple linear model.


## Libraries
Throughout this tutorial, we will use some libraries within R. If you would prefer to work through the examples on R, you will need to install the following libraries:

- `tidyverse`
- `truncnorm`
- `gridExtra`
- `BSDA`
